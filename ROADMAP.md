# 🛤️ S Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the complete development process of the S framework, from its core to extensions, including essential features and packages.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Core Architecture and Foundation

- [ ] **Framework Architecture Definition**
  - Establish the primary paradigm (inspired by TypeScript and PHP).
  - Define file structure and component organization.
  - Implement the transpiler and ensure compatibility with native PHP.

- [ ] **Transpilation Engine**
  - Support strict typing and dynamic annotations.
  - Implement caching system and optimize generated code.

- [ ] **Advanced Typing System**
  - Support primitive and complex types.
  - Static and dynamic type inference.
  - Constraints and generics (e.g., `T extends string`).

---

## 🔥 Phase 2: Core Functionalities and Standard Library

- [ ] **Error Handling and Exception Management**
  - Advanced error handling system.
  - Integrated logger for debugging and exception tracking.

- [ ] **Core Modules**
  - Module and dependency management system.
  - Standard Library for common operations (I/O, strings, arrays, etc.).

- [ ] **Validation and Parsing System**
  - Strict validation with expressive syntax (`filter(val).is_bool()`).
  - Parsing and value transformation (`parse(val).to_bool()`).

---

## 🌐 Phase 3: HTTP, API, and CLI Development

- [ ] **HTTP Layer and Routing**
  - Implement a router similar to Laravel’s routing system.
  - Support for middleware and request lifecycle management.

- [ ] **CLI and Developer Tools**
  - Develop a CLI tool (`s`) for managing projects.
  - Commands for creating components, running builds, and managing dependencies.

- [ ] **API and RESTful Services**
  - Implement a simple API layer with controllers and request validation.
  - Support for JSON responses and serialization.

---

## 🔐 Phase 4: Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] **Authentication System**
  - User registration, login, and session management.
  - Secure token-based authentication (JWT, OAuth2).

- [ ] **Authorization and Permissions**
  - Role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Middleware for enforcing policies and permissions.

---

## 🎨 Phase 5: Templating and Dynamic Rendering

- [ ] **Blade-Inspired Templating Engine**
  - Clean and intuitive syntax for views.
  - Component-based rendering and layouts.
  - Optimized compilation for performance.

- [ ] **Dynamic Data Handling**
  - Support for expressions and directives (`{{ }}`, `@if`, `@foreach`).
  - Security features to prevent injections.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 6: Plugin System and Extensions

- [ ] **S Package Manager**
  - Create and install custom modules.
  - Manage dependencies and documentation.

- [ ] **Interoperability with PHP and Laravel**
  - Easy integration with existing PHP frameworks.
  - Middleware and hooks for advanced extensibility.

---

## 🚀 Phase 7: Optimization and Finalization

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Improve the transpiler and execution engine.
  - Reduce memory consumption and compilation time.

- [ ] **Comprehensive Documentation**
  - Detailed user guide.
  - Tutorials and usage examples.

- [ ] **Official Launch** 🎉
  - Stable release on Packagist.
  - Community building and developer adoption.
